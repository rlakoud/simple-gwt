SimpleGWT provides Widgets for use in [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/) (GWT) applications. These Widgets are loosely coupled for easy integration with the standard GWT and other third-party libraries.

SimpleGWT currently targets GWT 1.6 and the final 1.6 release of [GWT Incubator](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator).

SimpleGWT is solidly pre-alpha. Use of the library and feedback are very much appreciated,  but please keep in mind that implementation and API are currently subject to frequent change. Things will be more stable after a version 1.0 release.
