ComboBox encapsulates a SuggestBox and an icon for showing a list of suggestions without typing anything first. Also supports opening and navigating the suggestion menu by keyboard.

**Note:** ComboBox requires a modified SuggestBox (modifications will, with any luck, be incorporated in GWT). In order to override the standard SuggestBox, simple-gwt.jar must preceed gwt-user.jar in your classpath.
